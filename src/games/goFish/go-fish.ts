/**
 * GO FISH: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Two to six players; seven cards each for two or three, five for four or
 * more, and the rest spread face down as the pond. On your turn, ask one
 * player for a rank you hold. If they have any, they hand you every one and
 * you ask again. If not, they say "Go fish" and you draw from the pond: draw
 * the rank you asked for and you show it and ask again; draw anything else
 * and your turn is over. Four of a rank is a book, laid down at once. A
 * player whose hand runs out draws a card when their turn comes, and sits out
 * once the pond is empty too. When all thirteen books are down, the most
 * books wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
