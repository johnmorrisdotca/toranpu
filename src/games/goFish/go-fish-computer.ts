/**
 * A COMPUTER AT THE GO FISH TABLE, which remembers what was asked.
 *
 * Everything said at the table is in the game's log, and the computer reads
 * it the way a player with a good memory would: a player who asked for sevens
 * holds a seven; a player who handed over their sevens, or said "Go fish" to
 * a request for sevens, holds none — until they draw from the pond, when
 * anything may have come in; and a rank booked is gone for good. It asks
 * whoever it knows holds a rank it has, the rank it holds most of first, and
 * otherwise the rank it holds most of from the player with the most cards who
 * is not known to be without it. It never looks at a hand it is not holding.
