 * A COMPUTER AT THE BIG TWO TABLE, playing as a sensible player does: lead
 * the play that sheds the most low cards (a run from the bottom of the hand
 * before a lone three), beat the table as cheaply as it can without breaking
 * up a pair or a triple it could play whole, and keep its aces and twos back
 * until somebody is close to going out or its own hand is nearly gone. When a
 * player is down to one card it stops leading singles they could beat.
 *
 * It reads a view of the game (`bigTwoView`): its own hand, what is on the
 * table, how many cards each player holds, and nothing else.
