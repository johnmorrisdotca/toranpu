/**
 * BIG TWO: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Two to four players, thirteen cards each (seventeen with three, the last
 * card going to whoever holds the three of diamonds). Whoever holds the lowest
 * card dealt leads, and that first play must include it. Round the table,
 * each player beats what is on the table with a play of the same number of
 * cards, or passes, and a pass holds until the trick is over; when everybody
 * else has passed, the last to play leads anything. The first to be rid of
 * every card wins the deal, and everybody else is charged a point a card left
 * — double for ten or more, treble for thirteen or more. After the game's
 * deals, the fewest points wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
