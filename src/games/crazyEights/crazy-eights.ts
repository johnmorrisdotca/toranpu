/**
 * CRAZY EIGHTS: the rules, and nothing else. The old public-domain game the
 * commercial colour-card games are built on.
 *
 * Two to seven players; seven cards each for two, five for more, and the top
 * card of the stock turned up to start the discard pile (an eight turned up
 * goes back under the stock). On your turn, play a card that matches the top
 * card's suit or rank. Eights are wild: play one on anything and name the
 * suit that must follow. If you cannot play, draw one card; if it can be
 * played you may play it, and otherwise your turn is over. When the stock
 * runs out the discards under the top card are shuffled into a new one; when
 * there are none, a player who cannot play passes, and a hand in which every
 * player passes in turn is blocked.
 *
 * The first out wins the hand and scores what everybody else still holds:
 * fifty for an eight, ten for a picture card, one for an ace and the face
 * value for the rest. A blocked hand goes to whoever holds the least, and
 * they score the rest. The first to the game's size wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
