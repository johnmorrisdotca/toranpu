 * cards far more often than it draws one: two names are equal when they are
 * the same card, a hand is a list of them, and a game kept as text is short.
 * They are the deck's own ids (`cardId` in `cards/deck.ts`), dealt from its
 * shuffle, and `cardOfId` turns one back into the deck's `Card` for drawing.
