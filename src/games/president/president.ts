/**
 * PRESIDENT: the rules, and nothing else. Known in Japan as Daifugō 大富豪,
 * "the grand millionaire", and at many a North American table by a ruder name.
 *
 * Three to eight players, the whole pack dealt round. Twos are high and threes
 * low, and suits do not count. The lead is one card, or two, three or four of
 * one rank; round the table each player plays the same number of cards of a
 * higher rank, or passes, and a pass holds until the trick is over. When
 * everybody else has passed, the last to play leads again. The first out is
 * President, then Vice-President, and the last is the Beggar. From the second
 * round, before play, the Beggar hands the President their two best cards and
 * gets two of the President's choosing back, and the Vice-Beggar and the
 * Vice-President swap one the same way (three at the table: one card, between
 * the President and the Beggar); then the Beggar leads.
 *
 * Every round scores a point for each player who went out after you, and the
 * most points after the game's rounds wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
