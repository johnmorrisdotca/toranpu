/**
 * EUCHRE: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Four players in two partnerships, partners across the table, with the
 * twenty-four cards from nine to ace. Five each, and the top of the four left
 * over turned up. Round the table from the dealer's left, each player may
 * order that card's suit as trumps (the dealer picks the card up and throws
 * one away) or pass; if all four pass, each may name another suit or pass,
 * and the dealer, last, must name one. In trumps the jack is the highest card
 * (the right bower), then the other jack of the same colour (the left bower,
 * which is a trump and no longer of its own suit), then ace, king, queen, ten
 * and nine. Follow suit if you can; the highest trump, or else the highest
 * card of the suit led, takes the trick. The partnership that made trumps
 * scores one for three or four tricks and two for all five; held to two or
 * fewer, it is euchred, and the other partnership scores two. The first to the
 * game's total wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
