/**
 * A COMPUTER AT THE EUCHRE TABLE. Making trumps, it weighs its hand in each
 * suit — the bowers, the trump ace and king, the aces outside and the suits
 * it is short in — and orders up or names a suit only with a hand that should
 * take three tricks with its partner's help, counting the turned card for its
 * own side when it or its partner deals. Stuck as dealer, it names its best.
 * Playing, it leads its best trump when its side made them, cashes aces,
 * leaves a trick its partner has won alone, and takes a trick as cheaply as
 * it can.
 *
 * It reads a view of the game (`euchreView`): its own hand, the card turned
 * up, the making so far and the cards played — nothing of another hand.
