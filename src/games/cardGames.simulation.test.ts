/**
 * THE CARD GAMES PLAYED OUT, many times, at every table they offer:
 * the simulator's questions (`simulation.test.ts` asks them of every board
 * game) asked of a card game, with its computer players at the table.
 *
 * - Computers alone, at every size and number of players, finish every game,
 *   and every seat wins some of them.
 * - A computer never makes a move the rules would refuse, and never finds
 *   itself with nothing to do.
 * - A computer beats players who choose at random, far more often than a
 *   random player would: a strategy, not a coin. (Not War, which has no choices.)
 * - A game kept half way reads back as exactly that game, and reloading it
 *   can never re-deal: the same seed and moves make the same cards.
