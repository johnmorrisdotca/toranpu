/**
 * GIN RUMMY: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Two players, ten cards each; the rest is the stock, its top card turned up
 * to start the discard pile. On your turn draw one card — the stock's top or
 * the discard pile's — then throw one onto the pile (never the one you just
 * took from it). Melds are three or four of a rank, or three or more in a row
 * of one suit, ace low. Every card in no meld is deadwood: an ace one, a face
 * card ten, the rest their number. With ten or fewer points of deadwood you
 * may knock instead of throwing: the other player lays their own melds, lays
 * off what fits onto yours, and the difference in deadwood is yours — unless
 * they have as little or less, which is an undercut and theirs, with 25 more.
 * Knock with no deadwood at all and it is gin: 25 and all their deadwood, and
 * nothing laid off. With two cards left in the stock and nobody out, the hand
 * is drawn. The first to the game's total wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
