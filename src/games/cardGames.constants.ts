 * THE CARD GAMES, and the tables each offers. A card game's "size" is how
 * long the game lasts, in its own terms:
 *
 * - Hearts, three or four: the score that ends it, 50 or 100 (the usual game).
 * - Big Two, two to four: how many deals, 1, 3 or 5, the fewest points winning.
 * - President, three to eight: how many rounds, 3, 5 or 7, the most points winning.
 * - Go Fish, two to six: one deal, played until every book is down.
 * - Crazy Eights, two to seven: the score that wins, 50, 100 or 200.
 * - Spades, four in two partnerships: the score that wins, 200, 300 or 500.
 * - Gin Rummy, two: the score that wins, 50, 100 or 150.
 * - Euchre, four in two partnerships: the score that wins, 5 or 10.
 * - Cribbage, for two: the score that wins, 61 (once round the board) or 121.
 * - Oh Hell, three or four each for themselves: how many deals, 7 (one card up to seven) or 13 (and back down).
 *
 * Every seat may be a person's or a computer's, so a table of one person and
 * three computers is a game of Hearts as much as four people round a phone.
