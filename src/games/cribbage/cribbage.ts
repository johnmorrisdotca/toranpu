/**
 * CRIBBAGE: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Two players, six cards each. Each lays two away to the crib, which is the
 * dealer's, and the top of the pack is cut as the starter (a jack cut scores
 * the dealer two, "his heels"). Then the pegging: from the dealer's other
 * hand, the players lay their cards in turn, calling the running total, which
 * may not pass thirty-one. Fifteen and thirty-one score two; a pair two, three
 * alike six, four alike twelve; a run of three or more, in any order, a point
 * a card. A player who cannot play says go, and the other plays on while they
 * can; whoever played last scores one for the go (or the two for thirty-one),
 * and the count starts again. The last card of all scores one. Then the show:
 * each hand of four, with the starter, scores two for every fifteen, two a
 * pair, a point a card of every run, four for a flush in the hand (five with
 * the starter; the crib only for all five) and one for the jack of the
 * starter's suit ("his nobs"). The other player shows first, then the dealer,
 * then the dealer's crib. The first to the game's total wins, the moment they
 * reach it.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
