/**
 * HEARTS: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Three or four players; every heart taken is a point and the queen of spades
 * thirteen, and the lowest score when somebody reaches the game's size (50 or
 * 100) wins. Before each deal three cards are passed — left, right, across
 * and then held, round and round (with three at the table: left, right,
 * held). The two of clubs leads the first trick, no points may be played to
 * it, and hearts may not be led until one has been thrown. Take all
 * twenty-six points in one deal and you have shot the moon: you score
 * nothing, and everybody else twenty-six.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
