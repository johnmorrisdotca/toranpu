 * A COMPUTER AT THE SPADES TABLE, bidding and playing as a steady partner:
 * it bids the tricks its hand is worth — aces, guarded kings, long and high
 * spades, the short suits it can trump — and nil only with a hand of nothing.
 * Playing, it takes the tricks its partnership still needs as cheaply as it
 * can, leaves a trick its partner is winning alone, ducks once the contract
 * is made (every overtrick is a bag), keeps out of the tricks when it bid nil,
 * and covers its partner's nil.
 *
 * It reads a view of the game (`spadesView`) holding its own hand, the bids
 * and what the whole table has seen, and nothing else: it cannot look at a
 * hand it is not holding.
