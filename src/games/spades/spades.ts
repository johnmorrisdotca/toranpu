/**
 * SPADES: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Four players in two partnerships, partners sitting across from each other.
 * Thirteen cards each; then each player, from the dealer's left, bids how many
 * tricks they will take — or nil, none at all. A partnership's contract is
 * its two bids added. Follow suit if you can; spades are trumps, and may not
 * be led until one has been played on another suit (unless the leader holds
 * nothing else). Make the contract and score ten a trick bid and one for
 * every trick over (a bag); fall short and lose ten a trick bid. Every ten
 * bags cost a hundred. Nil makes a hundred if its bidder takes no trick, and
 * costs a hundred if they take one. The first partnership to the game's total
 * wins — or, if one sinks to minus that total, the other does.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
