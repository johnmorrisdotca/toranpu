/**
 * THE RULES OF FREECELL, pure: every function returns a new table and leaves
 * the one it was given alone, as the engine does and as Klondike's rules do
 * (`solitaire/klondike.ts`), so a game is its deal and its moves.
 *
 * The rules as the site plays them:
 * - The whole deck is dealt face up into eight columns, from the left, one
 *   card to each in turn: the first four columns take seven cards, the rest six.
 * - A column is built down in alternating colours, a red 6 on a black 7, and
 *   any card may go into an empty column.
 * - A free cell holds one card, any card. The classic game has four; the
 *   set-up offers three or two for a harder one.
 * - Each suit's foundation is built up from its Ace. A card at home stays home.
 * - Only the top card of a column moves, but a run in order may go as a whole
 *   where it could have gone a card at a time through the free cells and the
 *   empty columns (`mostCarried`) — the "supermove" every program allows.
