/**
 * A FREECELL SOLVER, in the browser: best first (`bestFirst`), giving up
 * after a fixed number of tables, never after a fixed time, so the same deal
 * gets the same answer on a phone, a desk and the server. Depth first, as
 * Klondike's solver is, won about one deal in six fewer and took lines three
 * times as long (measured 2026-09-30).
 *
 * - SAFE MOVES ARE MADE AT ONCE: a card goes home when nothing left on the
 *   table could ever want to be put on it.
 * - TABLES ARE SEEN ONCE, remembered with the columns in any order and the
 *   free cells in any order, since neither order changes the game.
 * - THE LIKELY MOVES ARE TRIED FIRST: home, then a run onto a card that frees
 *   what was under it, then a card out of a cell, then into an empty column,
 *   and a card put into a cell last.
 *
 * It finds wins and never judges losses: a deal is called winnable only once
 * it has won it.
