/**
 * OH HELL: the rules, and nothing else.
 *
 * Three or four players, each for themselves. The first deal is one card
 * each, the next two, and so up to seven (and, in the long game, back down to
 * one); after each deal the next card is turned up, and its suit is trumps.
 * From the dealer's left, each player bids exactly how many tricks they will
 * take. The dealer bids last and may not bid the number that would make the
 * bids add up to the tricks there are, so somebody must miss. Follow suit if
 * you can; the highest trump, or else the highest card of the suit led, takes
 * the trick. Take exactly what you bid and score ten and your bid; take any
 * other number and score nothing. The highest score after the last deal
 * wins.
 *
 * Pure: every function returns a new game and leaves the one given alone.
