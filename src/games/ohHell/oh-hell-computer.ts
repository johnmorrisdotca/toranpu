/**
 * A COMPUTER AT THE OH HELL TABLE. Bidding, it counts the tricks its hand
 * should take — high trumps, long trumps, aces outside and, in a hand of a
 * few cards, kings — and bids the nearest it may. Playing, it tries to take
 * a trick while it has taken fewer than it bid, as cheaply as it can, and to
 * lose every trick once it has made its bid, throwing its most dangerous
 * cards while it can do so safely.
 *
 * It reads a view of the game (`ohHellView`): its own hand, the turned card,
 * the bids and the cards played — nothing of another hand.
