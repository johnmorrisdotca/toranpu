/**
 * A SPIDER SOLVER, in the browser: best first (`bestFirst`), giving up after
 * a fixed number of tables, never after a fixed time, so the same deal gets
 * the same answer everywhere, and a seed can name "the first deal from here it
 * wins".
 *
 * The moves it tries are the ones that change something: a run onto a card
 * one higher where it frees what was under it or joins its own suit, a run
 * into an empty column where it leaves something behind, and the stock last.
 * Moving a run from one card that takes it onto another of the same rank and
 * no better suit is left out, as nothing a person wants.
 *
 * It finds wins and never judges losses: a deal is called winnable only once
 * it has won it.
