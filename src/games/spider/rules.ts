/**
 * THE RULES OF SPIDER, pure: every function returns a new table and leaves the
 * one it was given alone, as Klondike's and FreeCell's do, so a game is its
 * deal and its moves.
 *
 * The rules as the site plays them:
 * - Two decks, dealt into ten columns: fifty-four cards, one to each column in
 *   turn, so the first four take six and the rest five, and only the top card
 *   of each face up. The other fifty are the stock.
 * - A card may go onto any card one higher, of any suit, or into an empty
 *   column. A run may move as a whole only if it is all one suit, in order.
 * - A full run of one suit, King down to Ace, is taken off the table by
 *   itself. Eight of them win the game.
 * - A face-down card left on top of a column turns over by itself.
 * - The stock deals one card face up onto every column at once, five times in
 *   all, and only while no column is empty.
