 * A SOLITAIRE GAME WRITTEN DOWN: the deal and the moves, each a short string.
 *
 * The deal is the deck in the order it was dealt, one letter a card
 * (`writeCards`), fifty-two letters: a puzzle's givens. The moves are what a
 * kept run, a finished game and its check all read: `d` turns the stock, `r`
 * turns the waste back over, and any other move is two characters, the pile
 * it leaves and the pile it lands on (`KlondikePile`). So a hundred-move game
 * is a couple of hundred characters, and its check is a replay, one move at a
 * time, with no search.
