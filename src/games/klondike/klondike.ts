/**
 * THE RULES OF KLONDIKE, pure: every function returns a new table and leaves
 * the one it was given alone, as the engine does, so a game is its deal and
 * its moves, and a table read back from a kept run is exactly the one its
 * moves make.
 *
 * The rules as the site plays them:
 * - Seven columns dealt from the left, one card more in each, the top card of
 *   each face up; the other twenty-four are the stock.
 * - Turn one card or three from the stock onto the waste (`draw`). Once the
 *   stock is empty the waste may be turned back over as the stock, as many
 *   times as the passes allow (`recycle`): unlimited, three passes in all, or one.
 * - A column is built down in alternating colours; any face-up run may move
 *   as a whole onto a card one higher of the other colour, and only a King, or
 *   a run headed by one, may fill an empty column.
 * - Each suit's foundation is built up from its Ace. A foundation's top card
 *   may come back down onto a column.
 * - A face-down card left on top of a column turns over by itself.
