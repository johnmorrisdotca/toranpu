 * beats what, is each game's own (`bigTwoHands.ts`, `president.ts`).

 * A seat is "in" while it holds cards. A pass holds until the trick is
 * cleared: the trick is cleared once every seat still in, apart from whoever
 * played last, has passed — and if whoever played last has just gone out,
 * once every seat still in has. Then the last player leads, or, if they have
 * gone out, the next seat round from them that is still in.
